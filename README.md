# hello-world2

-I am an electrical engineer who moved from Scotland to Colorado in 1995. Being a keen hobby photographer, I investigated sensor-operated camera traps, such as TriggerTrap and Time Machine, and, finding them sadly lacking, embarked on building my own. 
-Because this was for my own use, I determined to incorporate every useful feature I could imagine. Rather than having a range of sensors that could be plugged into a single jack socket, like the ones on the market, I built multiple sensors into the instrumant casing, eliminating the need to carry multiple sensors and their wiring to a shoot.
